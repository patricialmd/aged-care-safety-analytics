# Aged Care Safety & Wellness Analytics

## 🏥 My Story

### Growing Up in the Philippines

I grew up in a working-class family in the Philippines where both my parents were government employees. My dad retired as a registrar at a government university, and my mom as an auditor of government agencies. They taught me that accurate data affects real lives, a lesson that would later shape my career path.

As I got older and watched my parents age, I realised the biggest challenge was not just getting older. It was the system. In the last days of my dad's life, he was hospitalised and the bills were crushing. Healthcare in the Philippines was unaffordable, and there was no proper support for aging with dignity. Quality of life in senior years depended on whether you had money, not on data-driven care.

### Moving to Australia and Discovering Aged Care

When I moved to Australia with my mom, a senior citizen, I heard about aged care through news and my sister's stories such as structured support, health monitoring, and government subsidies. My sister and her family had access as citizens. My mom didn't. That gap pushed me to build solutions.

During my university studies, I created a prototype of a fire prediction mobile app as an academic project that alerts seniors when smoke is detected. Later, driven by personal need, I built a step-count dashboard tracking my mom's activity patterns to catch potential health issues early. Through these small projects, I realised something powerful: **data could be the foundation of better care**.

### My Commitment

That's when my passion for data and aged care began. I saw how data-driven tools could directly prevent emergencies and improve independence for seniors.

**This project represents my commitment to using data to give seniors the proactive, dignified care my father never had access to.**

**My focus:** Data analytics for aged care safety, specialising in fall prediction/prevention and daily health monitoring.
